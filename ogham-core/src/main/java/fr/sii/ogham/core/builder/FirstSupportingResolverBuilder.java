/**
 * <p>
 * Builder used to help construct the resource resolution. Resource resolution
 * is based on a lookup prefix. The lookup prefix is case sensitive and must end
 * with a ':'. It must not contain another ':' character.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, a resource path could be "classpath:/email/hello.html". The
 * lookup prefix is "classpath:".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The lookup can also be empty in order to define a kind of default resolver if
 * no lookup is provided. The resource path could then be "/email/hello.html".
 * The resolver associated to empty string lookup will be used in this case.
 * </p>
 * By default, the builder will use the following template resolvers:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Resolver that is able to handle classpath resolution (
 * {@link ClassPathResolver})</li>
 * <li>Resolver that is able to handle file resolution
 * ({@link FileResolver})</li>
 * </ul>
