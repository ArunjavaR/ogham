/**
 * Configure path prefix/suffix for a resource resolver.
 * 
 * You can set the path prefix/suffix for resource resolution. The aim is to
 * define only the name of the resource (or a subset) and the system will find
 * it for you. It avoids to explicitly write the whole path and let you change
 * the resource resolution easily.
 * 
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You have one template located into
 * <code>/foo/template/createAccount.html</code></li>
 * <li>You have one template located into
 * <code>/foo/template/resetPassword.html</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * So you can set the prefix path to <code>/foo/template/</code> and the suffix
 * to <code>.html</code>. You can now reference the templates using the file
 * name:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>createAccount</code></li>
 * <li><code>resetPassword</code></li>
 * </ul>
