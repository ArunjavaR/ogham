This sample shows how to send an email with a content following a template engine language.

The first lines configure the properties that will be used by the sender.
Then you must create the service. You can use the MessagingBuilder to help you to create the service.
Finally, the last line sends the email. The specified email is really basic too. It only contains the subject, the content based on a templated content available in the classpath, a bean to use as source of variable substitutions and the receiver address. The sender address is automatically added to the email by the service based on configuration properties.

<1> Use the standard builder (predefined behavior)
<2> Register the custom properties
<3> Create a MessagingService instance
<4> Send an email with a subject and a simple body. The sender address is automatically set using `ogham.email.from` property
<5> Indicate the path to the HTML template file (in the classpath)
<6> Use any bean object for replacing variables in template

Using a template is straightforward. Instead of providing a string content, you provide a `TemplateContent`.
The `TemplateContent` requires two information:

* The path to the template
* The variables to evaluate in the template

The path to the template is a string with a *lookup* prefix. The lookup prefix is used to indicate where to search the template (from file system, from classpath or anywhere else). Here we explicitly ask to load the template from classpath (using prefix `classpath:`). If no lookup is defined, classpath is used by default. See <<Resource resolution,Resource resolution section>> for more information.

The variables are any object you are using in your application. No need to convert your object to a particular format. Directly use what you want.
